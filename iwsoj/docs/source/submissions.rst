|
| The file **api.py** and class **SubmissionViewSet** are intended to provide access to users to available tasks from database which are stored in the table named **submissions_submission** . The submissions are stored in the **queryset** after successfull authentication.
|
| The class protects access to submissions againts unauthenticated users. 
|
| The access is authenticated by AuthUserToken which is set in field **authentication_classes**. If program got uncorrect or non-existent token, the program would denied access to submissions.
| We have the access thanks path: **api/submissions/** and method Bearer. Scheme of use method Bearer:
|
| "authorization: Bearer <AuthUserToken>"
|
| Now itâ€™s time to say something about **permission_classes**.
|
| Permission is a functionality of system what determines which request will be granted or denied. We use **permissions.IsAuthenticated** and that permission class will allow to access only for logged in user. If you are interested more about permissions and permission classes, `let's see <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/>`_ .
