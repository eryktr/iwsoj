| Submissions' migrations are used to contact and migration tasks between backend and database.
|
| If we want to transfer data between backend and database, it is important to ensure compatible format between them.
|
| In that program it is necessary to ensure:

- **id** field : is an auto_created primary key, which is not serialized
- **createdate** field : it is completed by default with current date
- every fields without error must be not-null

| This file was authomatically generated by Django.
